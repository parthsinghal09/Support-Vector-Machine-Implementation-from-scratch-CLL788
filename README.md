# Support-Vector-Machine-(SVM)-Implementation-from-scratch

This python based implementation of SVM solves the Dual Problem using the CXOPT package of python. The data 1 provided is linearly separable. SVM with the "Modified Optimization Problem" was implemented for data 2 as it is non-linearly separable. The model was tuned for the hyperparameter C in the modified optimization problem. 

More information about the implementation and the results can be found in the README.pdf file.
